There are some important skill that I considered when build a teamwork which are organizing, decision making, problem solving and communication skill. All these skills should be taken into account so that teamwork can be carried out properly and help each other. Therefore, teamwork educates individuals to become braver persons and have high leadership qualities.</p>
<p> I have the skill in time management. Good time management enables individual to work smarter not harder and the most important is producing quality and effective work. There are several characteristics that I have tried to practice to make sure I always manage time effectively such as be adaptable, be persistent, stay prepared and stay focused to make sure I am not delayed in completing a task. Effective time management helps individuals to present the best possible work as we will try our best to do our best such as research, discussion, etc. an individual will have plenty of time to do the job if time is well utilized.</p>
